\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 1: The player must be able to move forward, left, down, and right using the WASD keys}
		
\paragraph{Player Movement}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Player-Movement-M-1\\}

Type: Manual\\
					
Initial State: A scene is initially paused. The scene will have the player initialized at the center of the playable map, and a tree will be initialized at a position beside the player to act as a stationary marker.\\
					
Input: Start scene button, WASD keys \\
					
Output: Changes on screen. \\
					
How test will be performed:\\ The user will start the scene and the user will press down on the WASD keys. If the user notices that the position of the player changes in the scene relative to the tree, the test is concluded and is considered to have passed. If the player position stays the same relative to the tree's position while the user is pressing down on the WASD keys, the test is considered to have failed. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 2: The player must be able to lookin all directions by moving their mouse}
		
\paragraph{Camera Movement}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Camera-Movement-M-1\\}

Type: Manual\\
					
Initial State: A scene is initially paused. The scene will have the player initialized at the center of the playable map, and a tree will be initialized at a position beside the player to act as a stationary marker.\\
					
Input: Start scene button, mouse movement \\
					
Output: Changes on screen. \\
					
How test will be performed:\\ The user will start the scene and the user will move the mouse in any direction. If the user notices that the perspective of the player changes in the scene using the tree as a marker, the test is concluded and is considered to have passed. If the tree stays at the same position on screen while the mouse is moving, the test is considered to have failed. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 3: Zombie enemies must walk back and forth between random points in their 'spawn' circle, which imitates them walking around}
		
\paragraph{'Spawn' Circle}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Spawn-Circle-A-1\\}

Type: Automated\\
					
Initial State: A zombie enemy object is initialized at the center of its 'spawn' circle that will have a predetermined position on the playable map.\\
					
Input: void \\
					
Output: void or assertion error.\\
					
How test will be performed:\\ A test script will be created that initializes the test with the specified initial state. Within the test script, commands will be given for the zombie to move in any direction on the x, y plane of the the playable map, and will continue to move in that same direction until the zombie's position hits any point on the 'spawn' circle's perimeter; to which the zombie will change its directional movement and the process starts over again. Assert statements will be used to check if the zombie's position never passes any point along the 'spawn' circle's perimeter. After each change in direction occurs, a counter will be recorded. Once the counter reaches a specified amount, the test is concluded and the test is considered to have passed and nothing is returned (void). Any assertion errors will be considered as a failed test. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 4: Zombie enemies must start attacking the player when they come within a certain radius}
		
\paragraph{Attack Radius}

Input: void \\
					
Output: void or assertion error \\
					
How test will be performed:\\  A test script will be created that initializes the test with the specified initial state. Within the test script, commands will be given to the player to move towards the zombie's attack radius.  Once the player is within the zombie enemy's attack radius, the zombie will be given commands to attack the player, and the zombie's attack animation will be enabled. Assertion statements will be used to check if the zombie's attack animation is enabled. No assertion errors indicate a passed test, whereas assertion errors indicate a failed test.\\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 5: Zombie enemies must follow the player if they start running away while the zombie is in it's attack state}

How test will be performed:\\ A test script will be created that initializes the test with the specified initial state. Within the test script, commands will be given for the zombie to move in any direction on the x, y plane of the the playable map and will have its position constrained by it's spawn circle. Commands will be given to the player to move towards the zombie's 'spawn' circle center. If the position of the player and the zombie is at a certain distance from each other, commands will be given to the zombie to move its position towards the player and for the player to move away from the zombie's position. The change in position of the player and the zombie will be the same. Assertion statements will be used to check if the distance between the zombie's position and the player's position remains the same, and if the position of the zombie and player are not the same; while the zombie's position is not greater than a specified distance from the center of the 'spawn' circle.

Within the test script, commands will be given for the zombie to move in any direction on the x, y plane of the the playable map and will have its position constrained by it's spawn circle. Commands will be given to the player to move towards the zombie's 'spawn' circle center. If the position of the player and the zombie is at a certain distance from each other, commands will be given to the zombie to move its position towards the player and for the player to move away from the zombie's position. The change in position of the player and the zombie will be the same. Assertion statements will be used to check if the distance between the zombie's position and the player's position remains the same, and if the position of the zombie and player are not the same; while the zombie's position is not greater than a specified distance from the center of the 'spawn' circle. Once the zombie's position reaches this distance, the zombie will return to the center of its 'spawn' circle, concluding the test. No assertion errors indicate a passed test, whereas assertion errors indicate a failed test.\\

Within the test script, commands will be given to the player to attack one of the zombies. An assertion statement will be used to check if that zombie's current health value is lower than than its initial health value. Once the zombie's health value reaches zero, an item object will appear at a chance of 100\% at the position of the zombie before the zombie object is set to null (representing the first zombie's death). An assertion statement will be used to check if there exists an item object at the position where the zombie had died. The second zombie will undergo the same process as the first zombie, but an item object appearing at this zombie's position will have a chance of 0\%.
