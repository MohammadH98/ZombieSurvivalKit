\subsection{Overview of Document}

This document comprises of details regarding the test initiatives, test procedures, tools and techniques to be used, a testing schedule and facts which together serve as a reference for the test team to successfully test the software being developed.
\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
Zombie Survival Kit is a starting ground for aspiring game developers to help them create their own Zombie Survival First Person Shooter game, and has been built using the Unity 3D engine and C\#. Testing would involve verifying that the various mechanics and functionalities in place are working correctly and reliably.
 
\subsection{Test Team}
The test team comprises of the three members of Group 6, as well as all volunteers who help test the product via feedback provided in a Google Form after trying a demo of the product.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
The Unity3D engine shall play an instrumental role in the automated testing process. Many features of the product need no user input and are implemented automatically, which verifies their correctness. The interaction of certain game features with others (like collisions) are proved via mutual implication.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
Since the game is being developed using the Unity 3D game engine, which incorporates a compiler and a debugger, we will be using the outputs seen in the engine to guide our testing processes.

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
		
See Gantt Chart at the following url : \url{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/jonatans/Zombie_Survival_Kit/blob/018d6c62a03216446c1a934df1e510ec412cc91e/Doc/DevelopmentPlan/Gantt%20Chart%20-%20Group%206.gan} 

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 1: The player must be able to move forward, left, down, and right using the WASD keys}
		
\paragraph{Player Movement}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Player-Movement-M-1\\}

Type: Manual\\
					
Initial State: A scene is initially paused. The scene will have the player initialized at the center of the playable map, and a tree will be initialized at a position beside the player to act as a stationary marker.\\
					
Input: Start scene button, WASD keys \\
					
Output: Changes on screen. \\
					
How test will be performed:\\ The user will start the scene and the user will press down on the WASD keys. If the user notices that the position of the player changes in the scene relative to the tree, the test is concluded and is considered to have passed. If the player position stays the same relative to the tree's position while the user is pressing down on the WASD keys, the test is considered to have failed. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 2: The player must be able to lookin all directions by moving their mouse}
		
\paragraph{Camera Movement}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Camera-Movement-M-1\\}

Type: Manual\\
					
Initial State: A scene is initially paused. The scene will have the player initialized at the center of the playable map, and a tree will be initialized at a position beside the player to act as a stationary marker.\\
					
Input: Start scene button, mouse movement \\
					
Output: Changes on screen. \\
					
How test will be performed:\\ The user will start the scene and the user will move the mouse in any direction. If the user notices that the perspective of the player changes in the scene using the tree as a marker, the test is concluded and is considered to have passed. If the tree stays at the same position on screen while the mouse is moving, the test is considered to have failed. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Func. Req. 3: Zombie enemies must walk back and forth between random points in their 'spawn' circle, which imitates them walking around}
		
\paragraph{'Spawn' Circle}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Spawn-Circle-A-1\\}

Initial State: A zombie enemy object is initialized at the center of its 'spawn' circle that will have a predetermined position on the playable map.\\
					
Input: void \\
					
Output: void or assertion error.\\
					
How test will be performed:\\ A test script will be created that initializes the test with the specified initial state. Within the test script, commands will be given for the zombie to move in any direction on the x, y plane of the the playable map, and will continue to move in that same direction until the zombie's position hits any point on the 'spawn' circle's perimeter; to which the zombie will change its directional movement and the process starts over again. Assert statements will be used to check if the zombie's position never passes any point along the 'spawn' circle's perimeter. After each change in direction occurs, a counter will be recorded. Once the counter reaches a specified amount, the test is concluded and the test is considered to have passed and nothing is returned (void). Any assertion errors will be considered as a failed test. \\

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}
All the functional and non-function test cases as stated above have detailed instructions as to what constitutes a passed or failed test case. Each step within each test case are also described allowing for high traceability between test cases and requirements.
\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

\subsection{Movement and Camera}
		
\begin{enumerate}

\item{Movement\\}

Type: Manual
					
Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.
					
Input: W-A-S-D, Shift and Space keys on the keyboard.
					
Output: Change of player perspective in the game scene.
					
How test will be performed:
The user will press the W key on the keyboard. This causes the player to move towards the tree seen on the screen, and cross a red marking on the ground. This confirms that the player is moving forward with respect to the starting position. If the player's position remains the same as the starting position after pressing the W key, the test is considered a failure. The A, S and D keys move the player left, backwards and right respectively in a similar manner.
\newline
By pressing and holding the Shift key on the keyboard, the player should move at a faster speed compared to when the Shift key is not held down. If this behavior is not observed, the test is a failure.\newline
Pressing the Space bar shall cause the player to jump in the current position. If the player is in motion when the Space bar is pressed, the player should move in the direction of movement even when off the ground. If this behavior is not observed, the test is a failure.
					
\item{Camera\\}

Type: Manual
					
Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.
					
Input: Mouse movement
					
Output: Change of player perspective in the game scene.
					
How test will be performed: 
The user stays in the initial starting point, and moves the mouse in an arbitrary direction. The in-game camera should move in the same direction as the mouse, causing a change in the perspective of the player with respect to the game world. If this behavior is observed, the test is successful.
\newline
The speed of movement would depend on the hardware settings and are subject to change on each computer. If the player perspective fails to change after moving the mouse, the test is declared a failure. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inventory System}

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item{Inventory UI\\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.

Input: I button on keyboard

Output: A UI element shows up on the screen.

How test will be performed:
At any point of time, the user shall press the I key on the keyboard. This shall halt mouse-based camera movement, and a grid of items shall appear on the right hand side of the game screen. In case this behavior is not observed, the test is considered to have failed.

\item{Item pickup\\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.

Input: W-A-S-D, E and I buttons on keyboard, mouse movement.

Output: A new item shall be visible in the Inventory UI.

How test will be performed:
The user moves towards a pickable object using the W-A-S-D keys, and then uses the mouse to look at it. When the user is looking at the pickable object, the user presses the E button on the keyboard. This should make the pickable object disappear from the game screen. At this point, by pressing the I button on the keyboard, the user can see the pickable object appear as a small icon in the Inventory UI. This would indicate success of this test.

\item{Item drop\\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.

Input: I button on keyboard, mouse movement.

Output: An item shall be removed from the Inventory UI.

How test will be performed:
The user opens the Inventory UI using the I button. If the Inventory UI shows no objects in it, it means that the Inventory is empty and nothing can be dropped from it. If there is an object in the Inventory UI, the object icon has a small 'x' button on the top right corner of the icon. By left-clicking on this 'x' icon, the user can drop this item from the Inventory. If after clicking the 'x' button, the item still remains in the inventory, this test has failed.

\item{Item consumption\\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen.

Input: I button on keyboard, mouse movement.

Output: Player stats shall change.

How test will be performed:
The user opens the Inventory UI using the I button. If the Inventory UI shows no objects in it, it means that the Inventory is empty and nothing can be consumed from it. If there is an object in the Inventory UI, the user can left-click on the object icon to use the item. As an example, if the player has a fruit object in the inventory, then by clicking on the icon for the fruit object in the inventory UI, the player's health level is increased. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Enemy pathfinding}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {Enemy moving to player\\}

	Type: Automated
	
	Initial State: The player is instantiated at the center of the terrain and can see a tree on the screen, enemy zombies are seen moving around at various places in the game scene.
	
	Input: W-A-S-D and Shift keys on keyboard.
	
	Output: Player stats shall change.
	
	How test will be performed:
	The user sees many enemies walking around a position in the game scene. When the user moves the player (using the WASD and Shift keys) to within a certain distance of an enemy zombie, the zombie starts moving towards the player. If the player now moves away from the zombie, then at reaching a certain distance from the zombie, the zombie stops chasing the player and then starts moving about a position.
	
\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

Group 6's version of this implementation has almost caught up to and replicated the existing open source implementation's functionalities. Currently, both implementations have a basic testing environment, and not a full playable terrain created using Unity. Both programs also have an inventory and equipment system implemented, allowing the user to pick up various items into their inventory and consume/equip them as they please. \\

The open source project has implemented visibly equipping melee and ranged weapons and using them with animations, whereas Group 6 has not yet developed that far into the aesthetics of the project and currently only has a basic left-click enemy damage system. Although behind on that aspect, a basic enemy AI system has been developed where the enemies wander around in a certain radius, and follow/attack the player when they get too close.  The existing implementation does not have enemy AI and only has a still object that you can practice attacking with your weapons. \\

Parallel testing will not be used since much of the existing implementation is not fully complete or put together. Although it would have been useful, there are not many components to test that would be benefiecial in testing the current implementation aswell. The current project was inspired by the existing implementation in an attempt to finish and make it what it was designed to be like, but since the start of development it has become very independent and not attached to the open source code, making running tests on it not an effective use of time.


\section{Unit Testing Plan}

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

Unit tests for internal functions will be accomplished using ASSERT statements. As of now, these statements will be embedded in the C\# scripts in each testable function. In order to test that the code is functional, each statement will be placed under the main part of each function. Inside, certain values will be asserted to check if they are equal, or certain statements will be inputted and checked if they evaluate to true or false which will prove the correctness of the code.   \\

For example, assertion statements will be used to make sure the combat system is correct. After the code for the enemy attacking the player runs, there will be an assertion to check if the player's new health is equal to the player's old health minus the enemy's attack value. If the assertion passes, it is known that the the enemy has successfully attacked and reduced the player's health. The same thing is tested for the opposite scenario, where the player attacks the enemy. There is an assertion to check if the enemy's new health is equal to the enemy's old health minus the player's attack value. \\

Another example of unit testing that will be done is for the inventory system. Once the player picks up an item, it should be added into the first available inventory slot. Assertion statements can be used to check if the item was successfully placed into the slot. This is done by running an assertion that checks if the first available inventory slot is filled with an Item of the type that was just picked up. If the assertion passes, the player has successfully picked up the item into their inventory.

\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		

Currently, the implementation does not generate any output files, so no tests are necessary. As a design choice, it was decided to reset the game when the player dies to give the development kit more of a survival theme. Also since this is just a dev kit and not a fully fledged video game, saving the game and generating output files is not necessary. If any output files are added, this section will be updated and test cases will be added.
